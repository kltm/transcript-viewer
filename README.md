JavaScript Transcript Viewer Demonstration
===

* What is this?

This is a very basic demonstration of the possibilities of using basic
plotting packages to easily and simply create a viewer to look at
transcript information (e.g. GFF3 gbrowse downloads).

This is meant to stand as an argument against more complicated methods
of embedding a transcript viewer into a web application--what is here
uses basic data and simple drawing methods.

* Where can I see it?

The compiled and "usable" demonstration can be found [here](https://kltm.github.io/transcript-viewer/).

The data is a GFF3 file taken from
ZFIN [here](http://zfin.org/ZDB-TSCRIPT-110325-1752). Please see
http://zfin.org/ZDB-TSCRIPT-110325-1752 to see what was being modeled
towards.
